# ✅ Operators - are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# �� Python divides the operators in the following categories:
# 1. Arithmetic operators
# 2. Assignment operators
# 3. Comparison operators
# 4. Logical operators
# 5. Identity operators
# 6. Membership operators
# 7. Bitwise operators
# 8. Special operators
# 9. Unary operators
# 10. Relational Operator


 # Assignment Operators
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)
c += a # c = c + a

# Arithmetic Operators
a = 2
b = 20\
print(a + b) # Add
print(a - b) # Sub
print(a * b) # Mul
print(a / b) # Div
print(a % b) # Mod
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation
print(a // b) # Floor Div
print(a & b)
print(a | b)



 # Relational Operator
a = 10
b = 20
print(a > b) # greater
print(a < b) # lesser
print(a >= b) # greater or equal
print(a <= b) # lesser or equal
print(a == b) # equal - return in boolean
print(a != b) # not equal



 # Unary operators
age = +10
print(age)
num = -65
print(num)
r = age + num #BODMAS - Math
print(r)

#  Not Operator ( Works with booleans)
is_married = True
print(not is_married)

# Is Operator - used in list
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(list1 is list2)
print(list1 is not list2)
print(id(list1))
print(id(list2))
a = 5
b = 6
print(a is b)
