# oops - object oriented programming system

# class - it is a blueprint of an object
# object - it is an instance of a class
# attributes - variables
# behaviour - methods

# class - it is a blueprint of an object
class Student:
    # attributes
    name = "John"
    age = 20
    grade = "A"

    # behaviour - methods
    def study(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is studying.")

    def play(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is playing.")

# object? --

# procedural PL - top down approach
# object oriented PL - bottom up approach


# Procedural PL -> have only Funcions = It does no take care of the attribute and behaviour
# functions and do the task
# c, basic , fortan - PL languages

# close to real world
# OOPS = Class and objects
# talks about attributes and behaviour
# python, java, c#, c++

# students - attributes, behaviour
