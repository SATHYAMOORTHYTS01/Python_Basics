#1.Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number. num = 2 sq - 4, c = 8

num = 2
square = num ** 2
cube = 2 ** 3

print("area of square:",square)
print("area of cube:", cube)


#2.Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

num1=float(input("Enter the First Number:"))
num2=float(input("Enter the Second Number:"))

if num1>num2:
    print("First number is greater than second number")
elif (num1<num2):
        print("First number is less than second number")
elif (num1==num2):
        print("first number is equal to second number ")
