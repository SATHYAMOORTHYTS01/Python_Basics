# Tuple - collection of items
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
# Tuples are written with round brackets ().
# Tuples allow duplicate values.
# Tuples are immutable, meaning that their elements cannot be changed once created.
# Tuples are created by XXXXXXX a sequence of values separated by commas within round brackets ()


# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,5)
print(my_tuple)
print(type(my_tuple))

#my_tuple[0] = 21 # cant change the values - immuable in nature
print(my_tuple)
